[Source code](http://marioboehmer.blogspot.be/2011/01/rfid-with-arduino.html)
The RDM630 doesn't work on 3V3, 5V is absolutely needed.
Checking validity of RFID: store hashed version of key value in secure EEPROM.  Upon detecting key, calculate hash of the read key
and compare with the hashed version in the EEPROM

2PAP (this is 2way authentication.  We don't need this.  It's not needed that the key knows that the garage door is really the needed one).

A -> B : ID_A | ID_B | RANDOMNR_A+MSG
B <- A : ID_B | ID_A | RANDOMBR_B | HMAC(ID_B, RANDOMNR_A+MSG, RANDOMNR_B)
A -> B : ID_A | ID_B | HMAC(RANDOMNR_A, RANDOMNR_B)

HMAC(X) = SHA1(X + SECRETKEY);

CHAP:
A -> B : ID_A | ID_B | HELLO?
B <- A : ID_B | ID_A | RANDOMBR_B
A -> B : ID_A | ID_B | HMAC(RANDOMNR_B)

Ok, all of this above is very nice, but before all of this can happen, both devices need to share a common secret key.
How to get that secret key in these devices?  If we give all devices the same factory default secret key, then the compromise of one
device will compromise all the others as well -> low resiliency (In fact, they would only be compromised when a user is in the process of adding a key to the receiver).  This is the only case where the common key is used.

Pff... implementing ECDSA is not so easy either.  Documentation is lacking in the avr-crypto-lib.  Relic toolkit has better documentation.

Build Instructions Relic Toolkit:
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc
unzip relic-master.zip to folder relic-master
mkdir -p relic-build/
cd relic-build

	Can be used with a diversified key: diversified key=MAC(rootkey, serialnumber client).  The client needs to store this unique 		diversified key.  Compromise of this key will only affect one unit.  The host needs to store the rootkey.  In the garage system, 		all hosts need to share the same root key.  Only compromising a host device will lead to problems, that's less than 50% of the 		devices.

Security:
3 Parties:
Alice (remote)
Bob (door)
CA (Certification authority)
-----------------------------
Certificate contains: subject ID + subject public key + signature (signs all of the forementioned using the private key of CA) 
Alice & Bob have:
	two keyrings: 
		private keyring: contains its own private key
		public keyring: contains CA's public key
	its own certificate, signed by CA
-----------------------------
Setting up a session key between Alice & Bob (Computer Networks, §8.7.5):
A -> B : cert(B)? (to get Eb)
A <- B : cert(B)
A checks with the CA's public key if cert(B) is valid 
A -> B : Eb(A,Ra), cert(A)
B checks with the CA's public key if cert(A) is valid
A <- B : Ea(Ra,Rb,Ks)
A -> B : Ks(Rb)

Ea, Eb = public key or encryption function of that key with A's or B's public key respectively
Ra, Rb = nonce (=big random number) generated by A or B respectively
Ks = shared session key
cert(x) = certificate of subject x

Chinese module from Banggood has the SI24R1 chip.  Is this NRF24L01 or NRF24L01+? Appears to be NRF24L01+ because it works also on 250Kbps.
It seems that seeedstudio brought out an improved version with a 3V3-regulator on board.  Probably there had been some
complaints about power integrity for this module.
I added a 100nF and a 10uF elco on the supply pins of the module.
The range is disappointing.  2m outside of my closed garage door the reception is gone.  Inside in the house, the reception is ok downstairs, but on the first floor, when I move away from the stairs, reception is gone quickly.

Hmm...Maybe 2.4GHz modules are not ideal after all.  Let's try 868MHz modules.  That's what Hoermann uses also.

XBeePro (+10dBm output, -100dBm input)
Range is about 25m from indoors in the garage to the outdoor unit.

NRF24: 2.4G -> 2.525G in 127 steps of 1MHz
Channel 100: OK
Channel 127 doesn't work

More results on Google than HopeRF, but HopeRF has more links to libraries etc.  Maybe Microchip is more popular for professionals, 
while HopeRF modules are more used by hobbyists.
Below is the only useful code that could be found on the internet.  It has to be rewritten from scratch due to the Microchip copyright notice.

Convert the Arduino Uno to 3V3.
Reset line of the module must be HiZ, pull up to reset the module.
Range of this module is comparable with the original Hörmann remote

TRM-868-EUR tested:
Available at Mouser.be: €28,20 (expensive!)
The module with professional 868MHz antenna hung upside down in garage (antenna vertical).
The module in the street has a 82mm wire soldered to it.
The range is satisfying with the factory default settings.
Tests have been done with the low power mode (also +13dBm) to see what's the influence on the range.  Effect is considerable.
The range is comparable to that of the original remote of the door.  In the datasheet it's not clear what's difference in 
current consumption between DTS & LP-mode.
